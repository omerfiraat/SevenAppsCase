Here is the simplified text version of the README file:

User List App

This is a simple iOS application built using the MVVM design pattern, UIKit, and networking from JSONPlaceholder. The app fetches a list of users from an API, displays them in a table view, and navigates to a detailed user information screen.

Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of the MVVM architecture, manage networking, and pass data between views in a structured way. It also showcases the Repository Pattern for managing data.

Features
	•	User List Screen: Displays a list of users with their name and email fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API.
	•	User Detail Screen: Upon selecting a user, navigate to a screen that shows the user’s detailed information, including name, email, phone, and website.

Architecture

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:
	•	Model: Represents the data structure for the user.
	•	View: The user interface built using UIKit (TableView, ViewControllers).
	•	ViewModel: Manages the logic for fetching and handling user data. It communicates with the network layer and updates the view.

Networking Layer

The app fetches data from JSONPlaceholder using Alamofire. The Repository Pattern is used to manage data operations between the ViewModel and the network layer.

Repository Pattern

A repository handles API calls and provides data to the ViewModel, decoupling the networking logic and making it easier to manage and test.

Requirements
	•	Swift 5+
	•	iOS 12+
	•	Alamofire (for networking)
	•	SnapKit (for layout management)

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/omerfiraat/sevenappscase.git

	2.	Install dependencies using CocoaPods:

pod install

	3.	Open the .xcworkspace file in Xcode:

open UserListApp.xcworkspace

	4.	Build and run the project in Xcode.

Features & Functionality
	1.	User List Screen: Displays a list of users with name and email.
	2.	User Detail Screen: Displays a user’s detailed profile (name, email, phone, and website).

Unit Tests

Unit tests have been implemented for the following components:
	•	ViewModel
	•	Networking layer (API call)

To run the tests, press Cmd + U in Xcode.

Code Quality
	•	MVVM: Clear separation of concerns using MVVM.
	•	Networking: Network calls are handled by the NetworkManager class.
	•	Repository Pattern: Data is passed through the repository layer.
	•	Clean Code: Modular, well-commented, and easy to understand.

Instructions for Running the Project
	1.	Open the project in Xcode.
	2.	Run the app on a simulator or device.
	3.	The app will fetch user data and display it in a table view.
	4.	Tapping on a user will show detailed user information.
